# Financial_Vir
A personal finance categorizer in Javascript.

This is entirely a web app.  It is displayed through HTML/CSS and runs entirely on Javascript.  It is intended to run inside of the Node Webkit (now NW.js) framework/app.

However, any Javascript relying node.js is contained within my NW.js UI setup and therefore is not critical to the actual functionality of the app.  Therefore, this should run perfectly fine inside any major browser as well, but I will not be supporting its use within a browser.

I barely know what I'm doing with this.  This is the first time I've made a real app, the first time I've used git, the first time I've written heavily in Javascript.  I've learned a lot and this app has gone through several refactors already as I continue to learn more.
