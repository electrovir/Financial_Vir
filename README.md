# Financial_Vir
A personal finance categorizer in Javascript.

This is entirely a web app.  It is displayed through HTML/CSS and runs solely on Javascript.  It is intended to run inside of the Node Webkit ([now NW.js](http://nwjs.io)) framework/app.

Outisde of the NW.js setup, node.js is not used and is therefore not critical to the actual functionality of the app.  Therefore, this should run perfectly fine inside any major browser as well, but I will not be supporting its use within a browser.

**I barely know what I'm doing with this.**  This is the first time I've made a real app, the first time I've used git, the first time I've written heavily in Javascript.  I've learned a lot and this app has gone through several complete refactors already as I continue to learn more.  However, I'm very pleased with how well this is working so far.

#### Running in a Browser
Download all the files, then simply open "main.html" in a browser and everything else will take care of itself.
